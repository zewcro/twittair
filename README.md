# What is 'Twittair' ? : 

❇️ Twittair is a small one that I had the idea to set up to keep me busy during my free time and improve my development knowledge.

Technically the application is developed in JavaScript (ReactJS) and Python (Flask + Django Rest Framework), the database used is a NoSQL mongodb database.

The goal was to create an application strongly inspired by Twitter, to add and / or remove features that 'I' find useless, it's my project I do what I want :p


The application is developed from scratch, I do this in my spare time so updates can take a long time to arrive.
